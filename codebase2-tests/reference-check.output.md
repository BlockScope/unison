```unison
unique type Foo = Foo
```

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      unique type Foo

```
```ucm
.> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    unique type Foo

.> find

  1. unique type Foo
  2. Foo.Foo : Foo
  

```
