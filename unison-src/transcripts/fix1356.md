##### This transcript reproduces the failure to unlink documentation

Step 1: code a term and documentation for it
```unison
x = 1
x.doc = [: I am the documentation for x:]
```

Step 2: add term and documentation, link, and check the documentation
```ucm
.> add
.> link x.doc x
.> docs x
```

Step 3: Oops I don't like the doc, so I will re-code it!
```unison
x.doc = [: I am the documentation for x, and I now look better:]
```

Step 4: I add it and expect to see it
```ucm
.> update
.> docs x
```
But I don't see an update, so from here on I am in panic mode and have no clue what I am doing!

Step 5: maybe re-link it?
```ucm
.> link x.doc x
```

Step 6: Great that seems to have worked but let me check just in case

```ucm
.> docs x
.> display 1
```

Step 7: I have been guided to check `display 1`, so now let's try and unlink
to get rid of the second link.

```ucm
.> unlink x.doc x
```

Issuing the `unlink x.doc x` command here breaks ucm, and no transcript output is generated.
The captured output is `ucm: Maybe.fromJust: Nothing`
