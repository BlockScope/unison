```ucm:hide
.> builtins.merge
```

Add `List.zonk` to the codebase:

```unison
List.zonk : [a] -> [a]
List.zonk xs = xs
```

```ucm:hide
.> add
```

Now, typecheck a file with a reference to `Blah.zonk` (which doesn't exist in the codebase). This should fail:

```unison:error
-- should not typecheck as there's no `Blah.zonk` in the codebase
> Blah.zonk [1,2,3]
```
