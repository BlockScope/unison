Checks that squash and merge do the same thing, with nontrivial history that
includes a merge conflict.

```ucm:hide
.> builtins.merge
```

```unison
x.a.a = "af"
```

```ucm
.> add
.> fork x y
.> fork x s
.> fork x m
.> delete y.a.a
```

```unison
y.a.a = "fij"
```

```ucm
.> add
```

```unison
y.b.a = "wie"
```

```ucm
.> add
.> merge y.b y.a
.> delete.term 1
.> merge y m
.> squash y s
.s> todo
```
