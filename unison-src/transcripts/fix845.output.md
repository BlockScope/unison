Add `List.zonk` to the codebase:

```unison
List.zonk : [a] -> [a]
List.zonk xs = xs
```

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      List.zonk : [a] -> [a]

```
Now, typecheck a file with a reference to `Blah.zonk` (which doesn't exist in the codebase). This should fail:

```unison
-- should not typecheck as there's no `Blah.zonk` in the codebase
> Blah.zonk [1,2,3]
```

```ucm

  I'm not sure what Blah.zonk means at line 2, columns 3-12
  
      2 | > Blah.zonk [1,2,3]
  
  Whatever it is, it has a type that conforms to [builtin.Nat] -> o.
  

```
