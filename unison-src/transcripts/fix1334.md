Previously, `alias.term` / `alias.type` would fail if the source argument was hash-only. Also, `replace.term` / `replace.type` only worked on full hashes.

With the PR, the source of an alias can be a shorthash, and the arguments to `replace.term` / `replace.type` can be hash-qualified or names-only.

Let's make some hash-only aliases, now that we can.

```ucm
.> alias.type ##Nat Cat
.> alias.type ##Boolean Twoolean
.> alias.term ##Nat.+ please_fix_763.+
.> alias.term ##Universal.== please_fix_763.==
```

And some functions that use them:
```unison
f = 3
g = 4
h = f + 1 == 5

> h
```

```ucm
.> add
```

We used to have to know the full hash for a definition to be able to use the `replace.*` commands, but now we don't:
```ucm
.> names g
.> replace.term f g
.> names g
.> view.patch
```

The value of `h` should have been updated too:
```unison
> h
```
