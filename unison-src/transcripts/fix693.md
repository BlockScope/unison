This code should not type check. The match on X.x ought to introduce
a skolem variable `a` such that `c : a` and the continuation has type
`a ->{X} b`. Thus, `handle c with h : Optional a`, which is not the
correct result type.

```unison:error
ability X where
  x : a -> a

h : Request X b -> Optional b
h req = match req with
  { X.x c -> _ } -> handle c with h
  { d } -> Some d
```
