unique type Map k v = Tip | Bin Nat k v (Map k v) (Map k v)

mapWithKey : (k ->{e} a ->{e} b) -> Map k a ->{e} Map k b

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      unique type Map k v
      mapWithKey : (k ->{e} a ->{e} b) -> Map k a ->{e} Map k b

```
```ucm
.> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    unique type Map k v
    mapWithKey : (k ->{e} a ->{e} b) -> Map k a ->{e} Map k b

```
```unison
naiomi = 
  susan: Nat ->{} Nat -> ()
  susan a b = ()

  mapWithKey susan pam
  
```

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you

  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:

```
```ucm

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    naiomi : Map Nat ()

.> edit naiomi

  ☝️
  
  I added these definitions to the top of
  /home/dolio/Programming/unison/bugfixing/scratch.u
  
    naiomi : Map Nat ()
    naiomi =
      susan : Nat -> Nat -> ()
      susan a b = ()
      pam : Map Nat Nat
      pam = Tip
      mapWithKey susan pam
  
  You can edit them there, then do `update` to replace the
  definitions currently in this namespace.

.> undo

  Here are the changes I undid
  
  Added definitions:
  
    1. naiomi : Map Nat ()
