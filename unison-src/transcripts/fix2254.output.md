    f  : A Nat Nat Nat Nat -> Nat
    f2 : A Nat Nat Nat Nat -> Nat
    g  : A Nat Nat Nat Nat -> Nat

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would

    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      type A a b c d

```
```ucm
.a2> update

  ⍟ I've updated these names to your new definition:
  
    type A a b c d

.a2> todo
