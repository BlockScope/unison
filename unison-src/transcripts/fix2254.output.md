  ☝️  The namespace .a is empty.

.a> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    type A a b c d
    f  : A Nat Nat Nat Nat -> Nat
    f2 : A Nat Nat Nat Nat -> Nat
    g  : A Nat Nat Nat Nat -> Nat

.> fork a a2

  Done.

```unison
type A a b c d
  = A a
  | B b
  | C c
  | D d
  | E a d
```

```ucm
.a2> update

  ⍟ I've updated these names to your new definition:
  
    type A a b c d

.a2> todo

  🚧
  
  The namespace has 3 transitive dependent(s) left to upgrade.
  Your edit frontier is the dependents of these definitions:
  
    type .a.A a b c d
  
  I recommend working on them in the following order:
  
  1. g  : a.A Nat Nat Nat Nat -> Nat
  2. f  : a.A Nat Nat Nat Nat -> Nat
  3. f2 : a.A Nat Nat Nat Nat -> Nat
  
  

```
