This should not typecheck - the inline `@eval` expression uses abilities.

```unison
ability Abort where abort : x

ex = {{ @eval{abort} }}
```

```ucm

  I'm not sure what syntax.docUntitledSection means at line 3, column 9
  
      3 | ex = {{ @eval{abort} }}
  
  Whatever it is, it has a type that conforms to [elem] -> o.
  

```
This file should also not typecheck - it has a triple backticks block that uses abilities.

```ucm
.> load fix2238.u

  ðŸ˜¶
  
  The file "fix2238.u" does not exist or is not a valid source
  file.
