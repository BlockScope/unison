This should not typecheck - the inline `@eval` expression uses abilities.

```unison
ability Abort where abort : x

ex = {{ @eval{abort} }}
```

```ucm

  The expression in red needs the {Abort} ability, but this location does not have access to any abilities.
  
      3 | ex = {{ @eval{abort} }}
  

```
This file should also not typecheck - it has a triple backticks block that uses abilities.

```ucm
.> load fix2238.u

  ðŸ˜¶
  
  The file "fix2238.u" does not exist or is not a valid source
  file.
