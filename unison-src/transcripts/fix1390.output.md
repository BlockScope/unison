  Done.

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      List.map : (i ->{𝕖} o) -> as ->{𝕖} [i] ->{𝕖} [o]

```
```ucm
.> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    List.map : (i ->{𝕖} o) -> as ->{𝕖} [i] ->{𝕖} [o]

.> view List.map

  List.map : (i ->{𝕖} o) -> as ->{𝕖} [i] ->{𝕖} [o]
  List.map f as =
    go acc = cases
      []     -> acc
      h +: t -> go (acc :+ f h) t
    go []

```
