```unison:hide
type Day = Sun | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun

foo.bar : Nat
foo.bar = 23
```

```ucm:hide

```

This should typecheck, using the local `bar`:

```unison
use Text ++

bar : Text
bar = "hello"

baz = bar ++ ", world!"
```

This should also typecheck, using the local `oog.bar`. This shows you can refer to a definition in the file by any suffix that is unique to definitions in the file.

```unison
oog.bar = "hello"

baz = bar Text.++ ", world!"
```

This should also typecheck, using the local `Sun`, and not `Day.Sun` which exists in the codebase.

```unison
type Zoot = Zonk | Sun

use Zoot Zonk

flip : Zoot -> Zoot
flip = cases
  Sun -> Zonk
  Zonk -> Sun
```

Even though local definitions are preferred, you can refer to definitions in the codebase via any unique suffix that doesn't also exist in the file.

```unison
type Zoot = Zonk | Sun

use Zoot Zonk

blah = cases
  Day.Sun -> Day.Tue
  day -> day

blah2 =
  use Day Sun
  cases Sun -> Wed
        day -> day
```
