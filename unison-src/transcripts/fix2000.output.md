Checks that squash and merge do the same thing, with nontrivial history that
includes a merge conflict.

```unison
x.a.p = "af"

```

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      x.a.p : Text
      x.a.q : Text

```
```ucm
.> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    x.a.p : Text
    x.a.q : Text

.> fork x y

  Done.

.> fork x s

  Done.

.> fork x m

  Done.

.> delete y.a.p

Merge back into the ancestor.
