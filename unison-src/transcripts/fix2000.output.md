```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      x.a.a : Text

```
```ucm
.> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    x.a.a : Text

.> fork x y

  Done.

.> fork x s

  Done.

.> fork x m

  Done.
