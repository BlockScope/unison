Tests cases that produced bad decompilation output previously. There
are three cases that need to be 'fixed up.'
  1. lambda expressions with free variables need to be beta reduced
  2. let defined functions need to have arguments removed and
     occurrences rewritten.
  3. let-rec defined functions need to have arguments removed, but
     it is a more complicated process.

```unison
> Any (w x -> let
    f0 y = match y with
       0 -> x
       n -> 1 + f1 (drop y 1)
    f1 y = match y with
       0 -> w + x
       n -> 1 + f0 (drop y 1)
    f2 x = f2 x
    f3 y = 1 + y + f2 x
    g x h = h 1 + x
    g x (z -> x + f0 z))
```
