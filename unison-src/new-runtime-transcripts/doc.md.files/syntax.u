  # Basic formatting
  
    Paragraphs are separated by one or more blanklines.
    
    Text can be __bold__, *italicized*, ~~strikethrough~~, or
    ''monospaced''.
    
    You can link to Unison terms, types, and external URLs:
    
    * [An external url](https://unisonweb.org)
    * {Some} is a term link; {type Optional} is a type link
    * [A named type link]({type Optional}) and [a named term link]({Some}).
      Term links are handy for linking to other documents!

    ## Escaping formatting
    
       If you have some inline text you want to leave unparsed
       and have it render in a monospace font, surround it in
       two single quotes, like so: ''__some bold text__''
    
       If you don't want the monospace rendering, you can 
       use ''{{ .. }}'' to escape out to regular Unison syntax,
       for instance {{ docWord "__not bold__" }}.
       
    ## Sections and subsections
    
       Sections consist of section titles followed by zero or
       more paragraphs or other section elements (such as
       subsections). Sections can be empty.

lists = {{

# Lists

## Bulleted lists

Bulleted lists can use ''+'', ''-'', or ''*'' for the bullets. They can be nested, to any depth:

+ A
+ B
+ C
  - C1
  * C2

## Numbered lists

1. A
2. B
3. C

The first number of the list determines the starting number in the rendered output. The other numbers are ignored:

Numbered lists can be nested as well, and combined with bulleted lists:

1. Wake up.
  + What am I doing here?
  + In this nested list. 
2. Take shower.  
3. Get dressed.

evaluation = {{

## Evaluation 

Expressions can be evaluated inline, for instance @eval{1 + 1}.

Blocks of code can be evaluated as well, for instance:

```
id x = x

id (sqr 10)
``` 

}}

sqr x = x Nat.* x

includingSource = {{

# Including Unison source code

Unison definitions can be included in docs. For instance:

@source{type Optional, sqr}

Some rendering targets (like HTML) also support folded source:

@foldedSource{type Optional, sqr}

You can also include just a signature, inline, with @signature{sqr},
or you can include one or more signatures as a block:

@signatures{sqr, Nat.pow}

## Inline snippets

You can include typechecked code snippets inline, for instance:

* {{ docExample 2 '(f x -> f x + sqr 1) }} - the ''2'' 
  says to ignore the first two arguments when rendering. 
  In richer renderers, the ''sqr'' link will be clickable.
* If your snippet expression is just a single function application, 
  you can put it in double backticks, like so: ``sqr x``. This is 
  equivalent to {{ docExample 1 '(x -> sqr x) }}.
}}
