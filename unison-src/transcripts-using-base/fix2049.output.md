Tests some capabilities for catching runtime exceptions.

```unison
catcher : '{IO} () ->{IO} Result
catcher act =
  handle tryEval act with cases
    { raise _ -> _ } -> Ok "caught"
    { _ } -> Fail "nothing to catch"

tests _ =
  [ catcher do
      match None with Some x -> x
  , catcher do
      1/0
      ()
  , catcher '(bug "testing")
  ]
```

```ucm

  I found and typechecked these definitions in scratch.u. If you
  do an `add` or `update`, here's how your codebase would
  change:
  
    ⍟ These new definitions are ok to `add`:
    
      catcher : '{IO} () ->{IO} Result
      tests   : ∀ _. _ ->{IO} [Result]

```
```ucm
.> add

  ⍟ I've added these definitions:
  
    catcher : '{IO} () ->{IO} Result
    tests   : ∀ _. _ ->{IO} [Result]

.> io.test tests

    New test results:
  
  ◉ tests   caught
  ◉ tests   caught
  ◉ tests   caught
  
  ✅ 3 test(s) passing
  
  Tip: Use view tests to view the source of a test.

```
